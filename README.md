## Abstract 💭
Healthub is an iOS application that offers some useful health-related functions such as managing therapies or booking appointments for medical examinations.
Its main feature is the ability to **detect drug interactions** contained in therapies
> Healthub is a school project for the Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications course A.Y. 2022/2023 @Polimi <br>
It should not be used seriously in real life!

## WatchOS ⏱️
Healthub also offers a **companion app** for watchOS designed to quickly display the information contained in the main app
